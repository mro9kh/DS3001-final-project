Using canned versions of more advanced tools (boosting, bagging, random forests, neural networks, etc.) is deeply unsporting and thus not allowed. You can be creative about transforming variables, or combining decision trees with linear models or $k$NN. Try something interesting. Fail extravagantly.

        "  - Wrangling, EDA, and Visualization: How are are missing values handled? For variables with large numbers of missing values, to what extent do the data and documentation provide an explanation for the missing data? If multiple data sources are used, how are the data merged? For the main variables in the analysis, are the relevant data summarized and visualized through a histogram or kernel density plot where appropriate? Are basic quantitative features of the data addressed and explained? How are outliers characterized and addressed?\n",
        "  - Analysis: What are the groups' main findings? Do the tables, plots, and statistics support the conclusions? Is the research strategy carried out correctly? If the research strategy succeeds, are the results interpreted correctly and appropriately? If the research strategy fails, is a useful discussion of the flaws of the data collection process or the research strategy discussed?\n",
        "  - Replication/Documentation: Is the code appropriately commented? Can the main results be replicated from the code and original data files? Are significant choices noted and explained?\n",
